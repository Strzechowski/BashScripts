Current version of the script can be used in two ways.


OPTION 1
-----------------------------------------------------

Standard usage of the script is a simple interface to manipulate the address book.
Just start the script without any arguments to use the interface.

It has 4 options in the menu : 
Add
Edit
Search
Remove 

Further explanations are not needed. Just try using script and check the code.



OPTION 2
-----------------------------------------------------

Command line version, you can manipulate the address book directly from the terminal.

How to use CLI version:

Usage: ./test -i
              -a \"Name Surname Phone Email\"
              -r \"Name Surname\"
              -s \"Name Surname\"
              -h

    no arguments --- turns on user interface
              -i --- turns on user interface
              -a --- add a person
              -r --- remove a person by his/her name and surname
              -s --- search a person by his/her name and surname
              -h --- display this help window

There is no edit option in CLI Version, because it would become to meesy.
Just combine remove and add options.

[FUTURE]
Additional options to improve the script:
-disable adding someone twice to the address book
-add "cancel option"
